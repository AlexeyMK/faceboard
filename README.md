## Faceboard is an online collaborative board for groups.

Now you can easily create a photo board for your class, team or a work group...

More generally a single faceboard is supposed to act as an online hub for content relevant to a group of people. 
It can be viewed as a JSON-driven mini-CMS with some specific tools for ad-hoc groups of tech-savvy travelers 
(e.g. [hackerparadise.org](http://hackerparadise.org) or [thesurfoffice.com](http://thesurfoffice.com)). 
But you are of course free to invent your own usage scenarios.
