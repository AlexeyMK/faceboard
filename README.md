Faceboard is supposed to act as an online hub for content relevant to a group of people. It can be viewed as a JSON-driven mini-CMS with some specific tools for ad-hoc groups of tech-savvy travelers (e.g. [hackerparadise.org](http://hackerparadise.org) or [thesurfoffice.com](http://thesurfoffice.com)). But you are of course free to invent your own usage scenarios.
